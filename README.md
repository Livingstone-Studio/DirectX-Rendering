This is my repository for the first DirectX 11 tech demo I have made, using DX11 in conjunction with DX Toolkit.

This was my first attempt at creating a 3D renderer using DirectX 11 and was my introduction to the how 3D computer graphics
are made. I have come to really enjoy graphics programming and want to return to this project and refine it, as looking
back now, I can see many things I want to do differently - like introducing a shader class to simplify the shader selection process.
If you are curious about the changes I plan to make when I have spare time - I have a TODO comment in the main.cpp file, disclosing
areas I want to improve and expand on.

The project will not work if you were to download it from here - I have commerically licensed assets in the game
which have been removed from this repo so I can keep it public, that being said - I would like to release a version on
itch.io at some point after I am happy with any changes I make so I shall provide that once it is ready.
